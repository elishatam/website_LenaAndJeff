        <b>HOW WE MET</b> by Jeff
        <br>I met Lena during my rotation in the Neurosurgical ICU at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. Actually, while I'd like to think it was the timeless story of "love at first sight amidst medical catastrophes," we didn't technically "meet" that month. Even though we should have been talking every day for patient care, we didn't speak one word to each other for the entire month. I was certain that it was because she thought I was so ridiculously good looking. It wasn't until a mutual friend of ours (yes Samir, that's you) invited both of us out one night that we really talked for the first time - for eight straight hours, in fact. Our fates were sealed when we found Dirty Dancing on TV that night and bonded over knowing every single line from the movie. (Wait, did I just admit that I know every line from Dirty Dancing?) And since that day we've been inseparable - seriously.

        <br><b>HOW HE PROPOSED</b> by Lena
        <br>It was a Wednesday and I had just gotten back from work, still completely jet-lagged from our recent trip to China/Japan. Jeff had the day off and was in charge of the night's activities - he had planned a take-out dinner and evening golf lessons. I thought the golf idea was a little random but I was so tired that I just went with it. But first, I needed to take a nap. Jeff woke me up promptly after an hour and said that dinner was on its way. To kill some time while waiting for the food, he put in a movie... Dirty Dancing. We hadn't watched it since the first time we hung out. Being that this is one of my all time favorite movies, I was immediately engrossed and anxiously awaiting my favorite scene..., the "Hungry Eyes" montage. 38 minutes of the movie went by and all was as it should be until suddenly Jeff popped up on the TV screen (words don't do it justice...please refer to the pictures below) dressed like Johnny Castle. Completely taken by surprise, I leapt off the couch and blurted, "WHAT?!?" Jeff had spliced himself into the movie (with the help of Universal Studios..., thanks Matt). In a 3 minute monologue, he said things that made me laugh, blush, cry, and ultimately say, "YES!" Of course, of course...!!!" When I looked over at him he was on one knee with the most dazzling and perfect ring in his hand. My next question was, "Are we still going golfing?"
